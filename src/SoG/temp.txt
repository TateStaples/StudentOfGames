I am interested in HRT because in disucssions with Duke alumni and campus event recruiters,
your firm sounds like it does the style of trading trading that aligns with my engineering background the best.
I got into the field because of the unique intersection of performance computing and data-analytics. I hope for the
oppurtunity to work at HRT and do interesting work.
